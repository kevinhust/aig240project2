# Project 2 Assessment Answers

1. **What command did you use to launch the JetAuto robot in Gazebo?**
   `roslaunch jetauto_gazebo worlds.launch`
   *(Optional: For remote/headless execution, I also used `gui:=false` to improve stability over SSH sessions).*

2. **Which two other launch files were called when you launched `worlds.launch`?**
   The `worlds.launch` file includes:
   - `empty_world.launch` (to initialize the Gazebo world)
   - `spwan_model.launch` (to spawn the JetAuto robot model and its controllers)

3. **Describe the process of setting up the ROS workspace and creating the package.**
   The process involved:
   - Creating a root workspace directory (e.g., `~/ros_ws/src`).
   - Initializing the workspace with `catkin_init_workspace` (optional, as `catkin_make` handles it).
   - Creating the package using `catkin_create_pkg lab4_jetauto_control rospy geometry_msgs`.
   - Developing the Python control script (`jetauto_square_control.py`) inside the `scripts` folder and making it executable.
   - Building the workspace using `catkin_make` and sourcing the `setup.bash` file to index the new package.

4. **How do you estimate that the robot moved roughly 1 meter in each of the steps?**
   The estimation is based on open-loop timing control using the robot's configured velocity. By publishing a constant linear velocity (e.g., 0.1 m/s) and maintaining it for a specific duration (e.g., 10 seconds), the displacement is calculated as `Distance = Velocity * Time = 0.1 m/s * 10 s = 1.0 meter`.

5. **What challenges did you face with making the robot move in a straight line while turning, and how did you overcome them?**
   - **Encoding Issues:** The Python 2 interpreter on ROS Melodic threw a `SyntaxError` due to degree symbols (°) in the script comments. This was fixed by adding `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` at the top of the file.
   - **ROS Network Configuration:** Incorrect `HOST` and `MASTER` environment variables in `/etc/environment` caused nodes to be hidden in deep namespaces (e.g., `/192.168.64.4/`). This was overcome by resetting them to the default `/` placeholders.
   - **Simulation Stability:** Running Gazebo over a standard SSH session often results in process termination when the session disconnects. This was solved by using `screen` sessions to maintain a persistent ROS Master and Gazebo instance.
   - **Mecanum Kinematics:** Coordinating diagonal movement while rotating required precise timing for both linear and angular components to ensure the robot returned to the origin accurately.
