# Project 2 - Assessment Questions

1. **What command did you use to launch the JetAuto robot in Gazebo?**
   I used `roslaunch jetauto_gazebo worlds.launch`. I also found that adding `gui:=false` was really helpful when I was working over SSH, since it kept the simulation running more smoothly on my VM.

2. **Which two other launch files were called when you launched `worlds.launch`?**
   I checked the source of `worlds.launch` and it basically pulls in two other files: `empty_world.launch` to get the Gazebo floor and physics started, and `spawn_model.launch` which actually loads the JetAuto robot and its controllers into the simulation.

3. **Describe the process of setting up the ROS workspace and creating the package.**
   First, I created my workspace folders (`~/ros_ws/src`). Inside the `src` folder, I ran `catkin_create_pkg lab4_jetauto_control rospy geometry_msgs` to set up the package with the right dependencies. I wrote my control script in the `scripts` folder and made sure it was executable. Finally, I ran `catkin_make` back in the root of my workspace and sourced the `devel/setup.bash` so I could run the node using `rosrun`.

4. **How do you estimate that the robot moved roughly 1 meter in each of the steps?**
   I used the basic formula: Distance = Velocity * Time. In my script, I set the linear speed to 0.1 m/s and timed the movement for exactly 10 seconds. In the simulation, this covers exactly 1.0 meter. I used `rospy.Time` and a controlled loop rate to make sure the timing stayed consistent even if the simulation lagged a bit.

5. **What challenges did you face with making the robot move in a straight line while turning, and how did you overcome them?**
   I hit a few roadblocks. The first one was a super annoying `SyntaxError` because Python 2 didn't like the degree symbols (°) in my comments, so I had to add the UTF-8 encoding line at the top. Another issue was the robot not responding to commands because my `/etc/environment` had some incorrect network settings from earlier, which I fixed by resetting the `HOST` and `MASTER` variables. Lastly, the robot tended to drift during the final diagonal step and the turn wasn't perfectly 90 degrees due to inertia. I fixed this by recalibrating the linear-to-angular speed ratio and adding a "settle time" (pause) between steps so the robot wouldn't slide as much in Gazebo.
